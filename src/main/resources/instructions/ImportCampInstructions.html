<h2>Camp Import</h2>

<p>
    Files that are imported must have a .csv extension as such make sure that all your values are separated by commas.<br>
    It is important to note that when you specify a camp name that already exists in BSA Database this will <b>update the existing data.</b>
    To keep existing scouts attended you must specify them in the import.
    <br>
    When adding scouts attended please list all scout names of attending scouts after the camp. To signify a new camp leave an empty
    space between the last scout attended and the name of the next camp.<br>
    The following table will explain what data is valid and how to build our import file. The type and max values are related to the type of information that will be
    stored in the associated field (such as: Text or Number) and the maximum number of character allow in each field respectfully.<br>

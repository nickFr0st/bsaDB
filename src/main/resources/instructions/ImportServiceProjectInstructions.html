<h2>Service Project Import</h2>

<p>
    Files that are imported must have a .csv extension as such make sure that all your values are separated by commas.<br>
    It is important to note that when you specify a service project name that already exists in BSA Database this will <b>update the existing data.</b>
    When updating a service project to keep existing scouts attended you must specify them in the import as well.
    <br>
    When adding scouts attended please list all scout names of attending scouts after the service project. To signify a new service project leave an empty
    space between the last scout attended and the name of the next service project.<br>
    The following table will explain what data is valid and how to build the import file. The type and max values are related to the type of information that will be
    stored in the associated field (such as: Text or Number) and the maximum number of character allow in each field respectfully.<br>

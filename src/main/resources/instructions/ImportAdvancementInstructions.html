<h2>Advancement Import</h2>

<p>
    Files that are imported must have a .csv extension as such make sure that all your values are separated by commas.<br>
    It is important to note that when you specify a advancement name that already exists in BSA Database this will <b>update the existing data.</b>

    space between the last requirement and the name of the next advancement.<br>

    stored in the associated field (such as: Text or Number) and the maximum number of character allow in each field respectfully.<br>
